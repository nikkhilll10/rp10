a. Write an R program to learn about Tabulation and related concepts[ Hint: Contingency Tables, Selection of Parts, Conversion]
Contingency Tables-

# R program to illustrate
# Contingency Table
# Creating a data frame
 df = data.frame ( "Gender" = c("female", "Female", "Male")
)
"Name" = c("payal", "ranu", "pratham"),
0 #
Creating contingency table from data using table()
conTable = table (df)
o/p
print (conTable)

Selection of Parts-
# R program to illustrate
# Contingency Table
# Creating a data frame
 "Name" = c("Payal", "Ranu", "Pratham"),
df = data.frame (
)
"Gender" = c("Female", "Female", "Male")
# Creating contingency table by selecting a column
conTable = table (df$Name)
print (conTable)
 # Creating contingency table by selecting rows print (conTable1)
o/p
conTable1 = table(as.matrix(df [2:3, ]))
Conversion-
2024 3:28 PM
# R program to illustrate
# Contingency Table
# Creating a matrix
A = matrix (
c(1, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4, 7), nrow = 3,
ncol = 3
)
# Converting Matrix objects into tables
newTable = as.table (A)
print(newTable)

b. Write an R program to demonstrate various ways of performing Graphical analysis. [Hint: Plots, Special Plots, Storing Graphics]
#Load ggplot2
library("ggplot2")
#create a scatter plot
ggplot (iris, aes (x = Sepal. Length, y Sepal.width))+
geom_point (aes (color Species))
